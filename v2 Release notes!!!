🚀 CodeBox v2 — “The Community Update”

Welcome to the official rebranding of CodePit → CodeBox!

✨ What’s New in v2:
	•	Brand new name: Say goodbye to CodePit, hello to CodeBox 🎉
	•	User login: Now asks for your username to personalize your session.
	•	Dev community access: View and post updates to a shared posts.txt feed!
	•	Persistent posts: Everything you post is saved and shown across sessions.
	•	Cleaner structure: Logic split between packaging files and interacting socially.

🛠️ Existing Features Improved:
	•	Continued support for .json packaging of your Python files with metadata (name, version, author, etc.).
	•	Simpler interface, now with options and menus.

🧠 Why It Matters:

This update turns CodeBox from a simple file packager into a growing terminal-based dev network. It’s GitHub meets group chat — but command line style.
