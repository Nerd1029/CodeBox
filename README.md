# 💻 CodeBox

Welcome to **CodeBox** — a terminal-based developer tool that lets you **package your Python files** and post updates to a shared **dev community feed**.

Think GitHub, but simpler, funnier, and fully text-based.

## 🚀 What Is CodeBox?

CodeBox is your command-line playground for:
- Packaging Python files into clean `.json` metadata files
- Posting and viewing dev updates with other users
- Building a dev feed with real terminal-based social vibes

Made by devs, for devs who still love ASCII.
